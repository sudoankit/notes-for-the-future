# All the kids in the world.

"Change the world" - the everyday cliched phrase uttered by millions. Innovations would change the world they proclaim. The future shaped by metal and technology. 

Aren't we forgetting the very basic necessity of life? Learning?  If there's no one to experience the utopian future we dream of why the pain and effort to push technology. To make life easier if there's no life at all?  

Changing the world means watering the root of the new generation. The education system. 

Every child is the world is a beautiful stem of life that wants to grow and bloom. Education is the manure, the water that the child needs. 

Millions of children in low income countries paint in their memories in grey. Color is costly.

Our work is color which is affordable for all the children. Color to paint their education from grey to vibrantly beautiful like them. An affordable platform to play, enjoy and most importantly learn, infused with latest technology and careful passionate design. 

It's not for changing the future. It's for the kids as the future is made from the imaginations they have. That's what we are building. 

For the kids.
