# Dirt, dust and blood. 

India is 

You'll be walking on a road and you'll definately see one of these things:
1. Random cows
2. Stray dogs chewing on garbage 
3. People spitting or pissing.
4. Random folks dumping waste anywhere they feel.

Sometimes you can see all of that too in a flash of a moment.

India is big. People are not educated (yet). The mindset is different. They want bread on the table not a pollution free area. Unemployment is rampant. Stereotypes are flowing in almost every houshold. Child labour. Killings. Rape. Murder. Crime.

Amidst all this, there's beauty too. The edges of himalayas. The warm cup of local tea while it's raining from strangers. Helpful and radical people. Festivals of light. Sea of flowers. 

I don't care in what level India is covered in dirt, dust and blood. I'll just swipe away the hair from her beautiful face and love her. It's lovely here.
