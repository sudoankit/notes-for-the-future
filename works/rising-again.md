# Rise Again 

Can't you hear that tone of the piano, that the devil plays? An orchestra of ghosts, skeletons and their friends. Our souls paying the price to hear our death once again. 

This is the tale of this concert.

The skies are full of storms of tear, and my heart is breathing faster with every thunderstorm I hear. 

The cold wind that’s rustling the trees, my bones and dreams. I’m scared of that sinister creed that screams, the devils light that blocks my esteem.

Oh, Lord, let me pray for the chaos to pass, for my heart to bring pistols when the nightmares start.

In the West, the Sun shall rise. I find myself staring at the dark east sky. It’s morning when the darkness descends. Look at the hopeless horizon. The birds flying away while the young ones chirp and cry.
The malice, blobs of fury and anger that spreads.

The hardships of life, the pain in the heart, the sorrow that's ripe growing in my fields of thoughts. When the world falls to an end it's not the time to freeze. 

I'll rise again. I'll call my friends to walk arm in arm, into our fears, into the dark horizon, into the abyss. Tomorrow we are no longer prisoners, no longer we are afraid of the past. 

We'll rise just like a Shepard's tone, ascending every step that we take, every thought we think, every dream we dream.
