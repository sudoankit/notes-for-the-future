# Notes For The Future  

This is my collection of notes, experiments, tips and tricks to write more effectively saved in cloud for the future me.

I get a lot of questions how I write and how I can think of stuff. I have tried my best to answer those here. 

Also, this repo would serve as vault to many of my unpublished, on the spot or _write while you wait till parents finish shopping_ works.

## General Observations


## My Style

I ten to focus more on environment creation and human emotions. Let me explain with some examples, 

**Character** building.

> Longbottom was a mutinous kid. His appearance reflected his life. Frivolous hair, a sharp dirty face and  beaten marks. He knew he had to go forward the weary and painful path that his family had laid in the past. Treachery. Deceit. Rotten intentions. 

Notice that after I wrote "`His appearance reflected his life`", I added a paragraph of how he looked. Once you read it'll be obvious that his life wasn't easy. 

I also love to use one-two word sentences. `Treachery. Deceit. Rotten intentions.` Keeping the meaning short and to the point adds more poetry ( I feel so ) to the writing.

**Environment. **

> Present day. 1789 Olyvie. The Victorian fused steam punk city. Steam and oil drove it’s life. Metal and bismuth gave it’s protection. Corruption and greed of powerful men, were slowly eating it’s glory.

Examples:

- I’m sure you’re busy and will want time to mull this opportunity over. I’ll follow up in two weeks if I haven’t heard from you.
  
- For the project to stay on schedule, I’ll need a response from you in the next 24 hours if possible.

- I’m a longtime admirer of your work and have the greatest respect for your filmmaking expertise. I would love to ask you a few questions about how you financed your first film. Would you be game for a 15–20 minute phone call next week? My schedule is wide open all day Thursday and Friday if you have availability then. I promise to keep it brief.
