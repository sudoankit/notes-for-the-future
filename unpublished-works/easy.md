Ragged truth. 
The ominous memories of that night when I had a **damp crush** on the stars remind me of the obvious. Ragged truth of my sins. My life and soul twin. 
The **damage** had made my memories scattered. Drifting in my mind. Like stars on the sky but without any pattern, without any constellation. The delusions I was holding onto lay lifeless. Truth is a **dacoit** is disguise. I dared go against it and it retaliated. **Ceased** my love of life. **Crunched** away my happiness. 
People **claim** about the happiness they forge throughout their life but in reality itâ€™s a mad world outside.
