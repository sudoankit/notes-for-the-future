# Events in life : An memoir to our thought. 

Life is a great tool to utilize. To find and scrape the dimension of truth. To idolize. To fray the cotton of the our conscious universe.
It’s driven with agility. Events that take place and shape the imperfection. 

Events. I know a great deal about them. How they work, and what they are. Events that are important. Events that bring sadness. Events that craft big smiles. Events that work to make you feel happy.
The best part of events is the control. We control them. We manipulate. We are their master. 
Events are pitiful slaves.

But, sometimes.
Sometimes, they don’t obey their masters. Those stubborn ones. Weak but powerful. Fragile but strong. Feeble but ambitious. 

These.   
Those.

That event we talked about.
The one that didn’t obey us. Hated us. Freed form our mastery over it.   
The event that didn’t happen on our timeline.

We tried hard, pushed hard and cried hard.  
But, it didn’t happen.

Nothing bulged from it’s place. Not even a bit. Not even an hair.

We have to let these go. We have to carry on. Life continues. 

Senile, but wiser.   
Saddened, but experienced.  
Stiff, but calm.

Let it go. Let these events go.   
You tried, now let it go.
