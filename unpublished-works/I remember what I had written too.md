# White
I remember what I had written. 

_white drapes, while sarees, white sky, I saw white everywhere. I had come to meet my sister after a long long time. Little did I know, that those whites weren't the peaceful ones, those whites were something that I feared._

You know what's white also?                         
_the white packet of cigarettes_

 _the world had stopped for something she wasn't ready for. She hadn't done anything wrong. She just wanted to ease the pain. More and more she tried to ease, not knowing she was praying indirectly to ease herself too_                         

 _when they looked into her eyes, they were scared but still warm. Warm, comforting and helpful were her qualities which she left printed on her comrades._                         

 _from the smile that won hearts, the personality that made men cry out, the charming glee of her sisterhood she had abandon all sang sadly to the monotonous tone of a cigarette whistle_                         

 _it's said that death is peaceful and how correct it was! She couldn't take a puff and ease the pain nor I could see the amber dull glow of the cigarette end dance in her iris_                         

 _cherry blossoms fell on her, at 5 centimetres per second. People who loved cried around her, talked is hushed tones, and uttered sermons._                         

 _the clouds hurried to cry too, and before I realised what had happened, rain wet me but lost to my tears wetting my heart from inside for lay in front of me, was my sister is white. Everything else was grey._                         

 _I stood and knelt beside her, thinking the colourful days. I gave her some flowers to smell which her body graced after the torture by the drum filled cigarettes._                         

 _the rain, the atmosphere, the people, the soil, the soul, the life, her, me everything were stitched to make me think that  this isn't true if she had listened to me_                         

 _as my last left her finger and fell down to water a flower beneath, I left how I had come, but without a sister._                         

 _and life wasn't same again_                         
                       
Don't cry because of cigarettes.
